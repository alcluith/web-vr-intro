# web-vr-intro
Introductory WebVR activity based on the first tutorial in the [Frame Academy](https://learn.framevr.io/) series.

This starts with a working version of a scene with several other background pictures uploaded ready to use.  It can be useful as a short, introductory activity to the possibilities of Aframe before encouraging coders who enjoy it to work through the tutorials in sequence to learn more of the background.
