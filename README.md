# web-vr-intro
Introductory WebVR activity based on the first tutorial in the [Frame Academy](https://learn.framevr.io/) series.

This activity starts with a working version of a scene and guides the user through making some changes to create their own version of the scene.  It can be useful as a short, introductory activity to the possibilities of Aframe before encouraging coders who enjoy it to work through the Frame Academy tutorials in sequence to gain a more detailed understanding of the various techniques.
